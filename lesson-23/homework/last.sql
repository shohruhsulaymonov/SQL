	format(Dt, 'MM') as MonthPrefixedWithZero  
from Dates

--Puzzle 2: In this puzzle you have to find out the unique Ids present in the table. You also have to find out the SUM of Max values of vals columns for each Id and RId. For more details please see the sample input and expected output.
with CTEUnique as(
select distinct
	id,
	rid,
	max(Vals) over (partition by id) Max
from MyTabel
)
select 
	count(id) Distinct_Ids ,
	max(rid) Rid,
	sum(max) TotalOfMaxVals 
from CTEUnique

--Puzzle 3: In this puzzle you have to get records with at least 6 characters and maximum 10 characters. Please see the sample input and expected output.

select *
from TestFixLengths
where len(Vals) between 6 and 10

--Puzzle 4: In this puzzle you have to find the maximum value for each Id and then get the Item for that Id and Maximum value. The Challenge is to do that in a SINGLE SELECT. Please check out sample input and expected output.
select id,
	Item,
	vals
from (
	select
		id,
		Item,
		vals,
		row_numBER() over (Partition by id order by vals desc) rownum
	from TestMaximum tm1
	) t where rownum = 1
--Puzzle 5: In this puzzle you have to first find the maximum value for each Id and DetailedNumber, and then Sum the data using Id only. Can you do this both in a single SELECT ?. Please check out sample input and expected output.
select 
	id,
	sum(maxval) SumofMax
from (
	select distinct
		DetailedNumber,
		max(vals) over (partition by DetailedNumber, id) MaxVal,
		id
	from SumOfMax
	) t
group by id
--Puzzle 6: In this puzzle you have to find difference between a and b column between each row and if the difference is not equal to 0 then show the difference i.e. a â€“ b otherwise 0. Now you need to replace this zero with blank.Please check the sample input and the expected output.

select
	*,
	case when cast(a - b as varchar) = 0 then '' 
	else cast(a - b as varchar)
	end as OUTPUT
